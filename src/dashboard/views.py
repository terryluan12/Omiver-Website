Thank you for reaching out to Omiver with alternative breakfast meal plan suggestions for Sofia. We have written our feedback regarding your suggestion:

“Your veggie egg scramble recipe will be added to Sofia’s recommended breakfast meal plan. We would suggest adding customization with her favorite vegetables, including spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, peppers. For additional protein, we also recommend adding low-fat cheese. Similarly, she can also use egg whites instead of whole eggs to lower the recipe’s cholesterol levels.”

Your suggestion will be taken into account for future meal plan recommendations. If you have additional feedback regarding your client’s meal plans, please do not hesitate to reach out!

Best Regards,
Meal Planning Team
